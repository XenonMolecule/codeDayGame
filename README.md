# [Ter0: The Awakening](https://xenonmolecule.github.io/codeDayGame/)

## Inspiration

We all liked 8-Bit games and wanted to challenge ourselves.

## What it does

Well, we never eally set a story. We just made the game and that was that. While not fitting any one mold, it mostly resembles a RPG adventure game.

## How we built it

HTML,CSS and JS
